# kalman-filter

Truth be told: I never had to implement a Kalman Filter from scratch in any of my graduate school education.
I was too busy thinking about language theory and optimal control! However, Kalman Filters are _extremely useful_
in many applications. This repository is my playground fot developing Kalman Filters _from
scratch_ in Clojure. I will be following the material from these [great](http://greg.czerniak.info/guides/kalman1/) 
[sites](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/).

As of now, this code is not production worth; however, I hope for it to be educational to the Clojure community.
